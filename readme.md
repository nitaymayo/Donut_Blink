# Dount Blink

Donut Blink is an AI-powered application designed to help users monitor
their blinking behavior while using their computer. The app uses the
computer's web camera to capture video of the user's face and analyze
the video to detect when their eyes are open or closed. The app notifies
the user with a red rectangle around a closed eye and a green rectangle
around an open eye. The app is built using Python, TensorFlow, and Dlib
library, making it a powerful tool for anyone interested in developing
computer vision applications.

To quikly use the app on your computer open the <a href="Donut_Blink_Quick_Version.ipynb">short version</a> as colab notebook and run it

Video demonstration <a href="https://nitaymayo.github.io/Donut_Blink.html">here</a>

The AI model used in Donut Blink is based on the EfficientNetB0
pre-trained model as a feature extractor. The model has been trained
on a large dataset of images, allowing it to identify patterns and
features in the user's eye's states accurately. With this approach,
Donut Blink can detect eye behavior with high precision and accuracy,
making it a valuable tool for anyone interested in monitoring their eye
health while using a computer. The app's intuitive interface and ease of
use make it a great addition to anyone's toolbox, regardless of their
technical expertise.
